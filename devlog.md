Today I decided to work instead on the form validation for the birthday form. This is something that I learned recently from The Odin Project and thought that it would be a good way to get more practice. I am havine a lot of trouble getting the form validation to work the way that I want to.

Mainly, I am unable to get the form to validate based on any custom rules (such as the number of days in a month or months in a year). I am going to continue to work at this until I can get it working correctly. Ideally, I want to validate a field each time that a user leaves it (i.e. when the field loses focus). I am going to review this [tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-2-constraint-validation-api-javascript/) from CSS Tricks to learn more.

### Next Steps

_Continue to build form validation_
